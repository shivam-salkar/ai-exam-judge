# AI Exam Judge

**An online coding exam platform I'm building for college use.**  
It features a browser-based code editor, a live output panel, and upcoming features like AI-assisted judging and Supabase login. *Currently under active development.*

## 🎯 What this is  
When our college conducts programming exams, we used to write code on Turbo C and teachers would inspect both the source code and the output. With this project I want to build a **web-based system** where:  
- Students can **write code online** (in the browser)  
- They can **run and test** their code and instantly see output  
- They can **submit their code** when done  
- An **automated AI judging system** will evaluate the submission, give marks, generate suggestions and feedback  
- All results and submissions are stored in a database (Supabase) and tied to user login (college credentials)
